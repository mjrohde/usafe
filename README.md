# U SAFE website 2.0
Because of some errors, or what I believe to be not so user-friendly in the U SAFE website, I have created this website as an improvement to the original. This

## Main differences
### Videos
The original website contains som videos that are not allowed to be controlled by the user. I have allowed this in my version of the website. Along with the controls, the videos are in a little weird format, I have changed this by substracting from the width at which the videos are displayed. This

### footer
The footer in the original is not bad, but in my opinion it is confusing. In this version of the website, the footer contains three sectuions of information, links to navgate the website, contact information, and an about us display with a Linked-In icon.

### Re-arranging information
Some of the information displayed in the website is not easily accessible. To get the most important information about the bouy, you have to navigate away from the main page, which i find confusing. Instead the information of top speed, range and battery life is placed in the header of the main page, making it the first information every user sees when entering the website. 


### Forms
The forms in the original website is not bad at all, they are standard input fields, that look more than good enough. However, a little styling can never go wrong (this is not at all true...but hey, why not give it a shot, huh?), I have also added on change validation of the forms, meaning that every user will get information when what they have entered is valid or not. There is also an extra security with an alert system in case the input fields are empty. 

### Images
The images in the original website are all formated well and none are stretched, but they could be better (this is my subjective opinion), for some of the images in the main page, I have removed the background of the images, this is purely because in a section of three parts, the original website has 1 image without a background and 2 of them with a background. I believe having all three images the same (without a background) looks a tiny bit cleaner.
